    <h4>Director</h4>
    <h4>Jet Propulsion Laboratory</h4>
    <p>
    Dr. Laurie Leshin, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory since May
    2022, is a distinguished geochemist and space scientist with extensive
    leadership experience in academia and government, including senior NASA
    positions.
    </p>
    <p>
    Leshin was president of Worcester Polytechnic Institute from 2014 to 2022
    and previously served as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute School of Science
    dean. At NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center from 2005 to 2008, she served
    as director of science, then deputy director for science and technology,
    leading strategy, planning, and implementation of more than 50 Earth and
    space flight projects. In 2010, Leshin became deputy associate
    administrator of the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA
    Headquarters, overseeing future human spaceflight.
    </p>
    <p>
    Her numerous honors include NASA’s Outstanding Leadership Medal and
    Distinguished Public Service Medal, and the Meteoritical Society’s Nier
    Prize for outstanding research by a scientist under the age of 35. The
    International Astronomical Union named asteroid 4922 Leshin to honor her
    planetary science contributions. Leshin advised President George W. Bush on
    space policy, and Barack Obama appointed her to the Smithsonian
    Institution’s National Air and Space Museum advisory board. Leshin holds a
    bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Arizona State University, and master’s
    and doctoral degrees in geochemistry from Caltech.
    </p>

    <p>
    Dr. Rachel Klima is the Director of the Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium
    and a principal staff scientist in the Planetary Exploration Group at the
    Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. Dr. Klima’s research focuses on
    integrating laboratory analysis of lunar, meteoritic, synthetic, and
    terrestrial rocks and minerals with near through mid-infrared spectral
    measurements of solid bodies in the solar system to understand such topics
    as the thermal/magmatic evolution of the Moon, distribution of minerals,
    water, and hydroxyl on the lunar surface, and the composition of Mercury’s
    crust. Research honors include the NASA/SSERVI Susan Maher Niebur Early
    Career Award (2018), the NASA Carl Sagan Early Career Award (2012), and
    Asteroid 9287 Klima (2014).
    </p>
    <p>
    Dr. Klima has been involved with numerous missions to bodies throughout the
    solar system, beginning in graduate school with the Dawn Mission to the
    asteroids Vesta and Ceres, and the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, a hyperspectral
    imaging spectrometer flown on Chandrayaan-1. At APL, she has worked on the
    MESSENGER mission to Mercury, Europa Clipper, and the Lunar Vertex mission.
    She currently serves as the Deputy PI of the Lunar Trailblazer Mission and
    is a participating scientist on the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter.
    </p>
    <p>
    In her role as the Director of the Lunar Surface Innovation Consortium
    (LSIC), she and her team have worked to build a diverse community of over
    2000 participants from academia, industry, non-profits, and government to
    understand the technical gaps and development needed to establish a
    sustained presence on the Moon. For that effort, she and the team were
    awarded a NASA 2020 Headquarters Honor Award for Excellence in Innovation.
