Supporting On-Demand Communications for NASA's Deep Space Network
 (<a href="#abstract-6731" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-6731" class="collapse">
<p>Current scheduling of NASA’s Deep Space Network is laborious and static. The DSN is fully pre-scheduled where many users rely on a stable schedule to plan their own spacecraft activities, weeks and months in advance of execution. However, new classes of missions are emerging that may not need to be scheduled as far in advance, and may be event-driven in coming across science targets at unpredictable times. As such, a static DSN schedule may not be the best option for these types of missions. As part of an investigation into how these more autonomous missions could efficiently utilize DSN resources, we have been exploring and prototyping the infusion of a ”demand access” model into the DSN scheduling process. These users could take advantage of an on-demand mechanism to download data. In this paper, we describe a prototype of the demand access process which consists of reserving blocks of shared antenna time (demand access tracks) and utilizing special ”beacon” tracks to request access to those blocks. Furthermore, we dive into a proposed solution for how to best schedule the beacon tracks using an aggregated value function in order to minimize data latency and track starvation.</p>

Voice Control System for Human Spaceflight
 (<a href="#abstract-6205" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-6205" class="collapse">
<p>Voice Control has been identified as a potential human-computer interface (HCI) candidate for Human Spaceflight. It may be a viable HCI solution to address the risk that the Human Research Program has identified for future space missions-small crews, complex systems to control, and long communication delays with mission control. At NASA, voice control is being investigated to aid crew members in extravehicular activity (EVA) procedures, automate command/control environments, interface with RFID chips to query for misplaced items, space-to-ground communication, speech-to-text transcription, and substitution for ground support. While speech recognizers are becoming more common in Earth-bound environments, space flight can present a unique and challenging physical &amp; acoustical environment. Due to the time delays to/from the moon and more so Mars, terrestrial-type server farm solutions in space are not possible. Rather, every artificially intelligent system must be 100% offline in a cloudless solution - where 100% offline is defined as not dependent on a server farm such as used for Siri, Alexa, or Google.</p><p>Not only is a lack of a cloud-based speech control infrastructure a challenge to overcome in space flight, but current and future spaceflight missions do not have the luxury of extensive network bandwidth as we do on Earth. Network constraints requiring minimum bandwidth consumption often result in lower quality voice communications. Voice communication is deemed a critical component in every human spaceflight mission, yet crew member speech that has been compressed and coupled with various acoustic background noise can be difficult to understand. If compressed and noisy audio is processed by a speech recognition system, it may be prone to errors.</p><p>When building voice control for human spaceflight, a system needs to denoise crew member speech that includes high background noise, stationary and non-stationary acoustic noise, and adapts for reverberation within different environments. Reverberation varies between space suits with helmet bubbles, tight spaces inside rovers, or crew member habitat construction on different planets making common speech recognition difficult to adapt to the diverse acoustical environments. Current commercially available speech recognition engines are not tuned to spacecraft acoustic environments. To make matters more difficult, there is typically limited training data available which is necessary to improve performance within spacecraft and spacesuit systems. For extra-vehicular activities, a helmet creates a challenging reverberant  acoustical environment that can smear spoken words-making it problematic for the speech recognition system to understand what was said. Therefore, commands, acronyms, background noise, and other acoustical factors make voice control in human spaceflight a unique problem to overcome.</p><p>Finally, another key challenge to overcome is radiation hardness. Any on premise solution for speech recognition that is offline and works in Earth doesn’t necessarily mean it will work in space due to radiation effects on the computer processing unit (CPU). Current radiation tolerant CPUs pose a challenge for voice control due to lack of processing power and speed for a query to be processed.</p><p>This presentation will cover key challenges when developing voice control applications for human spaceflight. Next, the efforts that various teams at the Johnson Space Center are undergoing to find viable solutions for voice control in deep space missions are given. Finally, an explanation on why voice control is imperative to human spaceflight if mankind wants to engage in deep space missions. For instance, a spaceflight specific voice control system could be most useful when ground communication has a long latency or is nonexistent and crew members need artificially intelligent aid or ground support substitution to perform long duration missions.</p>

AI and Data-Driven In-situ Sensing for Space Digital Twin
 (<a href="#abstract-1627" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-1627" class="collapse">
<p>The formation and evolution of giant planets define the dominant characteristics of our planetary system. The giant-planet exploration can improve the understanding of heat flow, radiation balance, chemistry and can work as ground truth for exoplanets. Atmospheres of giant planets are larger and, in many respects, but simpler than that of Earth. Studying giant planets’ atmospheres and environments can serve as laboratories for the Earth atmosphere's fundamental physical and dynamical processes. On the other hand, exploring the relevant environments that affect the Earth's atmosphere can help us develop a sound technical and scientific basis in giant planets. Particularly, climate change on Earth is central to the question of understanding the roles of physics, geology, and dynamics in driving atmospheres and climates on Jupiter.</p><p>While Juno Mission has significantly enhanced our understanding of the Jovian atmosphere in every orbit through remote sensing, in-situ observations are essential for validating the models, studying the composition, and capturing the dynamic processes of gas giants. The singular in-situ observation made by the Galileo Probe in 1995 has a major disagreement with standard Jovian atmospheric models, making scientists believe the entry site may happen to be one of the least cloudy areas on Jupiter. This suspicion exhibits a strong limitation of free-fall probing. A logical next step, then, would be a mission with actively controllable probes that stay in the atmosphere of a gas giant for an extended duration. The 2016 NIAC Phase I study on ``WindBots'' by Stoica et al. found that an adaptive wing glider and a lightweight, quasi-buoyant vehicle would be a viable option by obtaining a lift from updrafts, however, autonomously navigating in the highly uncertain and turbulent flow field remains a major challenge. </p><p>The closest terrestrial analog to Jupiter's atmosphere would be the tropical cyclones (TCs) on the Earth. Although the formation mechanism of a TC is very different from GRS on Jupiter, the resulting phenomenon, represented by highly turbulent and strong wind field as well as its localized and dynamic nature, are similar, hence providing a suitable test ground for future missions to Jupiter's atmosphere. This paper develops an autonomous small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS) in-situ TC sensing, through the simulated environment of cooperative control of distributed autonomous multiagent systems deployed into the eye of TC. The main objective is to test various observing systems from single and multiple sUAS platforms close to the eyewall of the storm to capture essential measurements to be used in explaining the Jovian environment. Preliminary results demonstrated successful sUAS flight optimization for maximizing improvement of the quality of key measurements (e.g., 3-dimensional wind velocity, pressure, temperature, and humidity). Simulated sUAS flight toward the inner core of the TC boundary layer made high-resolution meteorological observations and supplemented existing partial knowledge for a better estimate of the TC intensity. This was a great addition to the task of testing sUAS technology, but a few methods have focused on the critical region of the storm environment and no data-driven optimal system design was developed to gain more information through exploring target locations. Anticipatory sUAS routing lowered the overall energy usage and maximized the reduction of forecasting error by exploring and sampling unobserved cells along the path to a target location. </p><p>This paper analyzes how online updating from sUAS collected meteorological data would benefit hurricane intensity forecasting considering the temporal variation of the uncertainty. Unobserved heterogeneity and randomness of the data have shown multiple modes in probability distribution in each location. A huge collection of multiple sources of granular microscopic data in each location may result in the loss of multivariate information if not retrieved properly. It is important to quantify the uncertainty of prior belief and update posterior when critical observations are obtained. However, traditional entropy theory cannot handle i) sequential learning multimodal multivariate information; ii) dynamic spatiotemporal correlation; iii) importance of observation for posterior approximation. In this paper, we advance autonomous in-situ sensing under highly uncertain and turbulent flow through a multi-variate multi-modal learning by analyzing the similarities between the different types of mixture distributions of multiple variables and allocating a cluster to each group across high dimensional time and space. Specifically, this paper can track structural information flow of temporal multi-variate multi-modal correlation data and automatically update the posterior, with the weights to the new observations through an iterative process. Extensive experiments on hurricane ensemble forecasting data demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines across various settings.</p>

Sequential Deep Learning for Mars Autonomous Navigation
 (<a href="#abstract-3433" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-3433" class="collapse">
<p>Recent advances in computer vision for space exploration have handled prediction uncertainties well by approximating multimodal output distribution rather than averaging the distribution. While those advanced multimodal deep learning models could enhance the scientific and engineering value of autonomous systems by making the optimal decisions in uncertain environments, sequential learning of those approximated information has depended on unimodal or bimodal probability distribution. In a sequence of information learning and transfer decisions, the traditional reinforcement learning cannot accommodate the noise in the data that could be useful for gaining information from other locations, thus cannot handle multimodal and multivariate gains in their transition function. Still, there is a lack of interest in learning and transferring multimodal space information effectively to maximally remove the uncertainty. In this study, a new information theory overcomes the traditional entropy approach by actively sensing and learning information in a sequence. Particularly, the autonomous navigation of a team of heterogeneous unmanned ground and aerial vehicle systems in Mars outperforms benchmarks through indirect learning.</p><p>Formulating a cost function with an appropriate valuation of information is necessary when knowledge of the information in one time and/or space gives conditional attributes of information in another time and/or space. This model, Sequential Multimodal Multivariate Learning (SMML) outputs informed decisions, conditioned on the cost of exploration and benefit of uncertainty removal. For instance, given an observable input, SMML is trained to infer posterior from samples taken from the same multimodal and multivariate distribution, approximate gains, and make optimal decisions. The utility is the usual metric to be optimized based on the difference between prior and posterior tasks, and it tells us how well the model is improving the data distribution after observation. Recall that, in general, it does not suffice to learn from average values like in the standard reinforcement learning problem to solve this kind of task, for this reason, SMML extends the capabilities of deep learning models for reinforcement learning whose reward for each action is restricted to unimodal or univariate distributions. In highly uncertain conditions, this reduction of entropy is vital to any optimization platform employed in the robust, efficient, autonomous exploration of the search space. To overcome  Shannon's limitation in multimodal learning, we consider both standard deviation and entropy. We target cells with the highest importance of information distinguishing two cells with identical entropy, but different values of information. </p><p>Predictive routing  is effective in knowledge transfer, however, ignore information gained from probability distributions with more than one peak. Consider a network with a grid laid on top, where each cell represents a small geographical region. To find an optimal route from an origin cell to a destination, forecasting the condition of intermediate cells is critical. Routing literature did not use a location's observed data to forecast conditions at distant non-contiguous locations' unobserved data. We aggregate the data from all the grid cells and cluster cells that have similar combinations of probability distributions. When one cell of a cluster is explored, the information gained from the explored cell can partially remove uncertainty about the conditions in distant non-contiguous unexplored cells of the same cluster. With this new framework, we explore the best options to travel with partial, sequential, and mixture of information gain.</p><p>We use observations obtained en route to infer the most likely conditions in unobserved locations. While distant unobserved locations may not share any inherent correlation with locally observed locations, classification errors by the image classifier may be correlated with certain image features found in different locations on the Martian surface. By clustering pixels with similar classifications, we gather evidence en-route that either supports or fails to support the hypothesis that the image classifier is making correct classification of the different terrain types. The two-step process (clustering - posterior) updates the state estimation of un-observed locations when navigating Jezero region of Mars environments in which prior belief is provided but contains high uncertainty. During 55 out of 100 runs in the Monte Carlo simulation the optimal expected travel time path based on the prior SPOC map resulted in the rover becoming stuck due to misclassification. Real-world misclassifications are expected to be lower compared with the ground truth map used in this research. Without considering runs in which the rover would have been stuck using the prior map, the median travel time was improved by 1 hour using the posterior. Travel time in the worst case outlier performance is improved by 2.32 hours and 75% quantile performance is improved by 1.61 hours. Over a mission spanning many months, this saving adds significant additional time for scientific experiments.</p>

Lot-to-Lot Variability and TID degradation of Bipolar Transistors Analyzed with ESA and PRECEDER Databases
 (<a href="#abstract-3084" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-3084" class="collapse">
<p>The NewSpace era has drastically increased the use
of COTS (Commercial-off-the-shelf Components) to cover the
needs of the new requirements: lower costs, shorter lead times,
and better performances. However, the radiation risks associated
with non-radiation hardened components are especially relevant
in this context. Therefore, new approaches must be considered
necessary to address this challenge for the assurance of radiation
hardness. This work presents standard and parameterized radiation
databases and how they can be used to numerically assess the
critical variability from lot to lot in response to gamma radiation
based on the coefficient of variation.</p>

Development of a Nanosatellite System Modeling Architecture for EIRSAT-1
 (<a href="#abstract-720" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-720" class="collapse">
<p>This paper discusses the adaptation of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) into CubeSat lifecycle development. This adaptation involves transitioning from traditional satellite design practices to a model-based design approach by developing system models required for analysis, trade-offs, verification and validation (V&amp;V). This approach has been applied to the launch-ready CubeSat, EIRSAT-1, which has been designed and developed by students and staff at University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland. The model contains several key features and components of EIRSAT-1. This poster presents the integration and verification of the communication link between the spacecraft and the Ground Segment (GS) within an MBSE framework.</p>

Benchmark Computer Performance for Wavefront Sensing and Control on Next Generation Space Telescopes
 (<a href="#abstract-9067" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-9067" class="collapse">
<p>Future planned space telescopes, such as the HabEx and LUVOIR telescope concepts and the recently proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory, will use high contrast imaging and coronagraphy to directly image exoplanets for both detection and characterization. Such instruments will achieve the ~10^10 contrast level necessary for Earth-like exoplanet imaging by controlling thousands of actuators and sensing with thousands of pixels. Updates to the wavefront control actuators will need to be computed within seconds, placing unprecedented requirements on the real-time computational ability of radiation hardened processors. In this work we characterize the wavefront sensing and control algorithms to estimate the performance based on publicly available benchmark performance for currently available space-rated processors.</p>

Coverage-guided State Space Exploration of Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems

<div id="abstract-9661" class="collapse">
<p>Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a substantial role in many domains, such as aerospace, transportation, critical infrastructure, and industrial manufacturing. However, despite the popularity of autonomous CPS, their susceptibility to errant behavior is a considerable concern for safety-critical applications.</p><p>Testing and simulation is the most common method used in practice to ensure correctness of autonomous CPS.

WannaFly: An Approach to Satellite Ransomware

<div id="abstract-4908" class="collapse">
<p>Ransomware is a prevailing concern across sectors, wreaking havoc on operations and causing cascading failures - often cyber-physical in nature. The space sector has not been immune to ransomware attacks; however, there has yet to be a publicly disclosed ransomware built for a space vehicle itself. A ransomware attack against a space vehicle would need to be carefully crafted to mitigate the risk of destroying the underlying functionality of the spacecraft, while still achieving its purpose - denying access until a ransom is paid. Through static code analysis, this paper proposes an approach for deploying a ransom attack against a space vehicle that engages NASA's core Flight System (cFS).</p>

<p>Access to space is increasingly fundamental to our modern world. Launch volume is rapidly increasing annually, requiring increasing spaceport and ground support capabilities. The design, ownership, and operation of spaceports are bespoke, where their cybersecurity considerations are always an afterthought.

Web-based 3D Visualization for Flight Mission Network Cybersecurity Analysis
 (<a href="#abstract-3470" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-3470" class="collapse">
<p>The Cyber Analysis Visualization Environment (CAVE) software system is a collaboration between the Systems Engineering and Mission Systems and Operations Divisions at JPL. CAVE is an easy to use, model-based cyber threat visualization, analysis, and assessment platform designed to respond to the growing threat of cyber attacks targeting space missions. CAVE was originally designed and developed as a Python-based desktop application with integrated 3D visualization, user interface, and a cyber analysis engine, before a recent redesign to the current client/server web-based application architecture. This new client/server web application architecture allows users to use CAVE on multiple platforms, requiring minimal or no software installation on their local systems while still allowing for a level of customizability at the user level. CAVE’s client/server architecture ensures that sensitive or proprietary data always resides securely on the CAVE analysis server, thereby avoiding the storage of any sensitive data on the end user‘s local machine. At the high level, the CAVE web server exposes a REST API to allow the web GUI to communicate with the analysis engine. The web server has user authentication capabilities, and restricts access to model data based on the assigned group of the authenticated user. The server is architected with a plugin structure in mind for analyses, so that anyone opting to deploy the CAVE server can easily write and deploy additional model analyses. Model data is stored in a Mongo database and delivered to the client via authenticated HTTPS request. The client handles all interactions with the web server and provides feedback to the user on the status of server requests. CAVE’s web-browser user interface provides an intuitive, 3D presentation of complex network models, containing both physical and virtual network assets, which allows mission cybersecurity engineers to easily swap between a selection of visual layouts and execute a variety of cybersecurity analyses algorithms designed to help users better understand possible network vulnerabilities and defenses. This web-based user interface model allows for ease of expansion and potential future additions to the user experience, including real-time collaboration and sharing capabilities, and the interactive exploration of large cybersecurity datasets. In this paper we present CAVE's software architecture and use cases, and discuss CAVE's value as an intuitive tool for cyber threat identification and assessment.</p>

Ablation Study of How Run Time Assurance Impacts the Training and Performance of Reinforcement Learning Agents
 (<a href="#abstract-3799" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-3799" class="collapse">
<p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become an increasingly important research area as the success of machine learning algorithms and methods grows. To combat the safety concerns surrounding the freedom given to RL agents while training, there has been an increase in work concerning Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL). However, these new and safe methods have been held to less scrutiny than their unsafe counterparts. For instance, comparisons among safe methods often lack fair evaluation across similar initial condition bounds and hyperparameter settings, use poor evaluation metrics, and cherry-pick the best training runs rather than averaging over multiple random seeds. In this work, we conduct an ablation study using evaluation best practices to investigate the impact of Run Time Assurance (RTA), which monitors the system state and intervenes to assure safety, on effective learning. By studying multiple RTA approaches in both on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms, we seek to understand which RTA methods are most effective, whether the agents become dependent on the RTA, and the importance of reward shaping versus safe exploration in RL agent training. Our conclusions shed light on the most promising directions of SRL, and our evaluation methodology lays the groundwork for creating better comparisons in future SRL work.</p>

The DART Autonomy System  
 (<a href="#abstract-5214" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-5214" class="collapse">
<p>This paper describes the Autonomy System that flew on the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission. A detailed description of the rules-based logic is provided, including the heritage of the system, how it was tailored to meet DART’s fault management philosophy, build process, testing, and necessary in-flight updates. The purpose of the Autonomy software was to implement fault protection against components’ off-nominal behaviors and to implement a safing strategy designed to place the spacecraft in a known, safe configuration in response to critical faults while Mission Operations worked on a resolution. Aside from maintenance and fault protection tasks, the onboard Autonomy software was key to guaranteeing the execution of time-critical sequences during the mission. The resulting system was also instrumental in being the tool of choice to address anomalies in other subsystems that were discovered as early as a month into flight and as late as a month before impact.</p>

Intelligent requirement-to-test-case traceability system via Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning
 (<a href="#abstract-8449" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-8449" class="collapse">
<p>Accurate mapping of software requirements-to-tests can assure high software reliability as a result of robust traceability, test coverage, and improved transparency. Software requirements change frequently across mission phases. A testable and measurable requirement maintenance and tracing are essential in all phases of mission life cycle. In a development phase, a predictable and controlled software system deployment, test, and integration can firmly support mission’s rapid innovations. In an operation phase, patches need to be applied periodically and prompt evaluation and verification turnaround are critical. By integrating and exercising Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) assisted model-based test engineering (MBTE) many of these challenges can be overcome. This paper will present a new and novel method and lesson learned from formalizing and automating the software requirement-to-test mapping, which allows engineers to review the recommendations generated by the automated system.</p>

This paper will show how different methods, including linear regression, k-means clustering, image segmentation, similarity functions, and euclidean distances, perform when analyzing datasets provided by the X-ray fluorescence spectrometer to assist scientists in understanding the distribution and abundance variations of chemical elements making up the scanned surface.

<p>The Modular Unified Space Technology Avionics for Next Generation (MUSTANG) is a small integrated Avionics system including Command and Data Handling (C&amp;DH), Power System Electronics (PSE), Attitude Control System Interfaces (ACS), and Propulsion Electronics. The MUSTANG Avionics Architecture is built upon many years of knowledge capture and lessons learned at the Goddard Space Flight Center.  With a motivation towards modularity and keeping board redesign costs to a minimum, MUSTANG offers flexibility in features with a backplane-less design and allows the user to choose the options (cards) needed for their system. It incorporates a distributed power system that provides secondary power to all its subcomponents reducing the number of primary services needed for an Avionics. MUSTANG can be integrated into one system or divided into several smaller components. MUSTANG supports redundancy and cross-strap ability for a more robust and reliable Avionics system. A variation of MUSTANG exists for Instrument Electronics called iMUSTANG and allows the user to select functionality applicable to the instrument electronics. MUSTANG is not meant to replace Avionics for all spacecraft. There are limitations due to its relatively compact size, but the MUSTANG design has proven broadly applicable on many spacecraft and instrument bus avionics architectures.</p>

A data pre-processing module for improved-accuracy Machine-Learning-based micro-Single-Event-Latchup detection
 (<a href="#abstract-8924" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-8924" class="collapse">
<p>Single-event-latchup (SEL) in a semiconductor device is an undesirably induced high current state, typically rendering the affected device to be non-functional and compromising its operating lifetime.  The lower-current SEL phenomenon – the micro-SEL – is often difficult to detect, particularly when the normal operating current of the protected device is variable and the magnitude of micro-SEL currents is different under different operating conditions.  In Machine-Learning (ML), the said variable current inadvertently affects the multiple features of the input current profile required for micro-SEL detection, thereby severely reducing the detection accuracy.  
In this paper, we propose a data pre-processing module to improve the accuracy of the ML-based micro-SEL detection under the aforesaid current conditions.  The proposed pre-processing module encompasses the following.  Prior to classification by ML, the input current profile is processed by a data pre-processing module employing a proposed background subtraction algorithm and proposed adaptive normalization algorithm.  By filtering the irrelevant base current and normalizing the micro-SEL current based on the base current value, the data pre-processing module provides improved accurate features of the input current profile and widens the difference between normal samples and micro-SEL samples in the feature space.  Ultimately, the proposed module facilitates ML algorithms to generate a more accurate decision boundary.  The outcome is a worthy ~13% accuracy improvement (from ~79% to ~92%) in the micro-SEL detection in a device operating with variable currents.</p>

Early Design Exploration of Space System Scenarios Using Assume-Guarantee Contracts
 (<a href="#abstract-421" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-421" class="collapse">
<p>We present a compositional approach to modeling and analyzing space mission operation sequences with steps across multiple viewpoints. We consider different tasks such as communication, science observation, trajectory correction, and battery charging; and separate their interactions across discipline viewpoints. In each sequence step, these tasks are modeled as assume-guarantee contracts. They make assumptions on the initial state of a step, and if these assumptions are satisfied, they guarantee desirable properties of the state at the end of the step. These models are then used in Pacti, a tool for reasoning about contracts. We demonstrate a design methodology leveraging Pacti's operations: contract composition for computing the contract for the end-to-end sequence of steps and contract merging for combining them across viewpoints. We also demonstrate applying Pacti's optimization techniques to analyze the figures of merit of admissible sequences satisfying operational requirements for a CubeSat-sized spacecraft performing a small-body asteroid rendez-vous mission. We show that analyzing tens of thousands of combinations of sequences and operational requirements takes just over one minute, confirming the scalability of the approach. The methodology presented in this paper supports the early design phases, including requirement engineering and task modeling.</p>

A Hybrid Space Architecture for Robust and Resilient Satellite Services
 (<a href="#abstract-1162" data-toggle="collapse">abstract</a>)
<div id="abstract-1162" class="collapse">
<p>A `hybrid space architecture' has been proposed to facilitate robust and resilient satellite data downlink, integration and analysis; however, the technical details for what may comprise a hybrid space architecture are severely lacking. Thus far, `hybrid' principally entails the diversity of commercial providers. While diverse suppliers can contribute to hybrid space architectures, we argue that robustness and resilience will only be achieved through heterogeneous network and asset architectures.  A connected satellite services ecosystem composed of the union of different networks with different characteristics would limit single points of failure, thereby generating high levels of redundancy, resilience and scalability. This research outlines parameters of a hybrid space architecture, documents satellite service reference architectures and provides a comparative analysis of the features for each architecture.  Further, through a case study of existing satellite service providers, we propose how a hybrid space architecture could be piloted in Northern Europe and the High North.</p>

Availability Vs. Lifetime Trade-Space In Spacecraft Computers

<div id="abstract-1361" class="collapse">
<p>This paper presents a trade space comparing forty-eight different configurations for redundant computer systems in spacecraft, in terms of their availability versus lifetime metrics.  Each of these configurations uses a different redundancy scheme.  Failure modes include transient failures due to radiation effects in space, such as Single Event Upsets (SEUs) and Single Event Functional Interrupts (SEFIs) and permanent failures due to degradation.  Configurations include various combinations of up to four total processors, with at least one of them being a prime, and the others, hot or cold spares.  Dual, Triple, and Quad Modular Redundancy are covered, along with some deployed spacecraft configurations, e.g. the Parker Solar Probe, and the Curiosity rover during its Entry, Descent, Landing (EDL) phase.  Some hypothetical designs lie outside the convex hull of previously-known configurations.</p>
