   <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
    This workshop aims to gather renowned specialists in the field of autonomous systems for space missions,
    as well as other relevant application domains like automotive, aviation, and defense.
    Together, they will explore the necessity of autonomy in both present and future space missions,
    while also examining the approaches employed by different industries in developing, verifying,
    and implementing capabilities that facilitate autonomous operations.
    </p>

    <p>
    The primary objective of this workshop is to identify successful techniques utilized
    in various application domains that can be adapted and implemented within the space science context.
    Furthermore, we aim to pinpoint the existing research gaps that demand attention in order to engineer
    highly reliable autonomous systems for space applications. By sharing experiences and insights,
    we seek to bridge the knowledge gap and foster collaboration towards achieving this common goal.

    <h3>Increasingly Autonomous Perception and Decision Systems for Advanced Air Mobility</h3>

    <br>
    <b>Abstract</b>. Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) including passenger transport and Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) requires 
    autonomy capable of safely managing contingency responses as well as routine flight.  
    This talk will describe pathways from aviation today to a fully autonomous AAM of the future.  
    Research toward comprehensive low-altitude flight environment mapping will be summarized.  
    Assured Contingency Landing Management (ACLM) requires a pipeline in which hazards/failures 
    that risk loss of vehicle controllability or loss of landing site reachability trigger 
    contingency response.  Pre-flight preparation of contingency landing plans to prepared 
    landing sites is supplemented by online planning when necessary.  
    Dynamic airspace geofencing in support of UAS Traffic Management (UTM) will be 
    defined and compared with traditional fixed airspace corridor solutions. 
    The talk will conclude with a high-level mapping of presented aviation solutions
    to space applications.

    <br>
    <b>Abstract</b>. Machine learning (ML) technologies are being investigated 
    for use in the embedded software for manned and unmanned aircraft. 
     ML will be needed to implement advanced functionality for increasingly 
     autonomous aircraft and can also be used to reduce computational resources 
     (memory, CPU cycles) in embedded systems.  However, ML implementations such 
     as neural networks are not amenable to verification and certification using 
     current tools and processes.  
    This talk will discuss current efforts to address the gaps and barriers to 
    certification of ML for use onboard aircraft.  We will discuss new verification 
    and assurance technologies being developed for neural networks.  
    This includes formal methods analysis tools, new testing methods and coverage metrics, 
    and architectural mitigation strategies, with the goal of enabling autonomous systems
     containing neural networks to be safely deployed in critical environments.  
     We will also discuss the new certification guidance that is under development 
     to address the gaps in current processes.  
     The overall strategy is to start will approvals of low-complexity and 
     low-criticality applications, and gradually expand to include more complex 
     and critical applications that involve perception.

    <a href="https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/murray#profile-d0b3cee6-tab">Richard Murray</a>, Thomas E. and Doris Everhart Professor of Control and Dynamical Systems and Bioengineering, California Institute of Technology
    <br>
    <b>Abstract</b>. Safety certification of autonomous vehicles is a major challenge due to the complexity of the environments in which they are intended to operate.
    In this talk I will discuss recent work in establishing the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of test and evaluation by combining advances in formal methods for specification and verification of reactive, distributed systems with algorithmic design of multi-agent test scenarios, and algorithmic evaluation of test results.
    Building on previous results in synthesis of formal contracts for performance of agents and subsystems, we are creating a mathematical framework for specifying the desired characteristics of multi-agent systems involving cooperative, adversarial, and adaptive interactions, develop algorithms for verification and validation (V&V) as well as test and evaluation (T&E) of the specifications, and perform proof-of-concept implementations that demonstrate the use of formal methods for V&V and T&E of autonomous systems.
    These results provide more systematic methods for describing the desired properties of autonomous systems in complex environments and new algorithms for verification of system-level designs against those properties, synthesis of test plans, and analysis of test results.

    He is currently the Thomas E. and Doris Everhart Professor of Control & Dynamical Systems and Bioengineering at Caltech. Murray's research is in the application of feedback and control to networked systems, with applications in biology and autonomy.
    Current projects include analysis and design of biomolecular feedback circuits, synthesis of discrete decision-making protocols for reactive systems, and design of highly resilient architectures for autonomous systems.
