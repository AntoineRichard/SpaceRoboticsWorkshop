*To help authors prepare their papers for submission, we offer to
provide feedback on abstracts submitted in advance. This step is not
compulsory, and authors may submit papers without previously submitting
an abstract.

Sponsored by: IEEE Computer Society - Technical Committee on Software
Engineering and Technical Committee on Computer Architecture.

We invite submissions for the International Conference on Space Mission
Challenges for Information Technology (SMC-IT) and the Space Computing
Conference (SCC). These conferences gather professionals, such as
system designers, engineers, computer architects, scientists,
practitioners, and space explorers, who are committed to advancing
information technology and improving the computational capabilities and
dependability of space missions. These forums provide a valuable
opportunity for in-depth technical dialogues covering various aspects
of space mission hardware and software.

Systems in all aspects of the space mission will be explored, including
flight systems, ground systems, science data processing, engineering
and development tools, operations, telecommunications,
radiation-tolerant computing devices, reliable electronics, and
space-qualifiable packaging technologies. The entire information
systems lifecycle of the mission development will also be covered, such
as conceptual design, engineering tools development, integration and
test, operations, science analysis, and quality control.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) space applications
of the following:

SMC-IT
Robotics, Cybersecurity, Networking, Memory and Storage, Advanced
Ground Control, Data Analytics and Big Data, Fault-Tolerant Processing,
Intelligent and Autonomous Systems, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality
and HCI, Manufacturing and Assembly of Large Structures, Advanced
Computing for Novel Instruments and Improved Operations, Software
Reliability for Mission-Critical Applications and Safety of Life.

SCC
Components, Radiation, and Packaging, Computing Architectures, Flight
Data Processing, Avionics Systems, Machine Learning/Neural Computing,
Crew Interfaces, Extreme Environments Computing, Distributed Computing,
Infusion and adoption of industry standards for space applications.
(The organization committee is considering to have a closed door
session. If you might be interested in submitting work for that
session, please contact the chairs at: smcit-scc_chairs@jpl.nasa.gov.)

Process and Format:

The SMC-IT/SCC 2024 Technical Committee is seeking two kinds of
submissions at this time: full papers (BOTH SMC-IT AND SCC) and
presentations (ONLY SCC).

SMC-IT/SCC 2024 will use a single-pass, full-paper review process.

The full paper is required and peer reviewed prior to deciding on
acceptance for the conference, even if an abstract has been submitted.

Full papers can be up to 10 pages, not including references. The paper
template can be found on the SMC-IT/SCC 2024 website
https://smcit-scc.space/submissions.html.

All accepted papers will be published in the IEEE conference
proceedings, indexed with the IEEE Xplore database. Note that IEEE has
a "Podium and Publish" policy for conferences, which means that no
manuscript will be published in IEEE Xplore without first being
presented at the conference.

Authors of SCC presentations without a corresponding paper need to
submit a 1-page abstract, which will allow the conference organizers to
determine if the proposed presentation is germane for the conference,
determine which track/session the proposed presentation belongs,and
ensure the author is in contact with the track/session chair for
feedback prior to the final submission. All presentation-only abstract
submissions must be submitted by the full paper deadline.

All submissions are uploaded via EasyChair
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=smcitscc2024.

Selected papers may be invited to appear in a special issue of a
reputable journal. More details will be made available in the future.

Note: It is not required to submit an abstract prior to the paper
submission.

website https://smcit-scc.space/#organization.
