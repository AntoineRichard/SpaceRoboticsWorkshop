We invite workshop proposal submissions for the IEEE International
Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology
(SMC-IT) and the IEEE Space Computing Conference (SCC). These events
seek to gather professionals, such as system designers, engineers,
computer architects, scientists, practitioners, and space explorers, who
are committed to advancing information technology and improving the
computational capabilities and dependability of space missions. This
forum provides a valuable opportunity for in-depth technical dialogues
covering various aspects of space mission hardware and software.


Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) space applications
of the following:

SMC-IT: Robotics; Cybersecurity; Networking; Memory and Storage;
Advanced Ground Control; Data Analytics and Big Data; Fault-Tolerant
Processing; Intelligent and Autonomous Systems; Augmented
Reality/Virtual Reality and HCI; Manufacturing and Assembly of Large
Structures; Advanced Computing for Novel Instruments and Improved
Operations; Software Reliability for Mission-Critical Applications and
Safety of Life.

SCC: Computing Architectures; Flight Data Processing; Avionics Systems;
Machine Learning/Neural Computing; Crew Interfaces; Extreme Environments
Computing; Distributed Computing Infusion and Adoption of Industry
Standards for Space Applications; Components, Radiation, and Packaging.


To submit a workshop proposal, kindly provide a 1-2 page abstract
outlining the theme, scope, and objectives of your workshop, along with
any prospective speakers you’ve already identified. Also, please ensure
that your proposal clearly defines the intended format of the proposed
workshop.  You should specify whether the workshop format includes
presentations only, papers, posters, working sessions or a combination
of them. Additionally, please specify your preference for a full-day
workshop or one/two half-day time slots. You can access a workshop
proposal template at
