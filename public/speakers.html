  <h1>Eugene Tu</h1>
  <h2>Center Director</h2>
  <h2>NASA Ames Research Center</h2>

  <p>
    Dr. Eugene L. Tu is the center director at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley,
    where he leads a staff of civil servants and contractors in providing critical research and development
    support that makes the aeronautics and space missions of NASA and the nation possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tu was most recently director of Exploration Technology at Ames, a position he held from November 2005
    until his selection as Ames center director in May 2015. There he led four technology research and
    development divisions, including two of NASA’s critical infrastructure assets: the consolidated arc jet
    testing complex and the agency’s primary supercomputing facility.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tu began his career as a research scientist conducting computational fluid dynamics research on the
    steady and unsteady aerodynamics of complex aircraft configurations. After progressing through various
    research and managerial positions in such fields as computational aerodynamics, information technology,
    or IT, and high performance computing and communications, he was selected as the deputy program manager
    for the agency’s IT Base Research program in 1997. In 1998, he was selected as the program manager for
    the agency-level High Performance Computing and Communications, or HPCC, program and concurrently led
    both the IT Base Research and HPCC programs. In 2001, the two programs were combined into the Computing,
    Information, and Communication Technology, or CICT, program and Tu was selected as the CICT program
    manager. In 2002, he was selected into the Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program,
    SESCDP, and served in the Office of Biological and Physical Research at NASA Headquarters in 2003, and
    as the acting director for the Information Sciences and Technology Directorate at Ames in 2004. After
    receiving his SES certification in 2005, he was selected as the director of Exploration Technology at
    Ames.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tu earned his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley,
    in 1988, and both his master’s degree and doctorate in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford
    University in 1990 and 1996, respectively. He is an associate fellow of the American Institute of
    Aeronautics and Astronautics. Tu received the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal in 2000, and the
    Presidential Rank Awards for Meritorious Executive and Distinguished Executive in 2009 and 2020,
    respectively. Tu lives in Fremont, California, with his wife Kathy and three children. His hobbies
    include attending sporting events, traveling, and motorsports.

  <h1>Jason Aspiotis</h1>
  <h2>Director, In-Space Infrastructure and Logistics</h2>
  <h2>Axiom Space</h2>
  <br/>
  <h3>Axiom Station and the World’s 1st Orbital Data Center</h3>
  <p>
    Axiom Space is building the world’s first commercial space station – Axiom Station – with the first module
    to be attached to the ISS in 2026. Axiom Station is being developed to address existing and future markets
    in human spaceflight, government research programs in LEO, in-space manufacturing, and advanced in-space
    infrastructure and logistics capabilities, including scalable, cloud-enabled, and cybersecure orbital data
    center infrastructure. As economic activities and space-based networking continue to grow in Earth’s
    orbit, Axiom Space recognizes the importance of in-space computing infrastructure as integral to the
    advancement of space-based communications, cybersecurity, and AI/ML-enabled operations. Moreover, as
    humanity expands its activities beyond Earth’s orbit, in-situ cloud computing provides the necessary data
    infrastructure backbone as we return to the Moon to stay, and endeavor further to explore Mars and the
    rest of the solar system.
  </p>
  <h4>About the speaker</h4>
  <p>
    Jason leads Axiom Space's strategy and services development in national security, orbital data
    infrastructure, Space mobility and logistics (SML), and in-Space servicing, assembly, and manufacturing
    (ISAM). Jason has 20+ years of experience in technical, organizational and project leadership, R&D,
    systems engineering, strategy, finance, and business development in the Space, defense, and financial
    technology industries. Prior to Axiom Space he was CEO of Finsophy, a Senior Associate at Booz Allen
    Hamilton, and a Chief Engineer at Raytheon. He has BS degrees in Physics and Astrophysics, a MS in Applied
    Physics, and a MS in Engineering Management.

  <h1>Elizabeth Turtle</h1>
  <h2>Planetary Scientist</h2>
  <h2>Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory</h2>

  <p>
    Dr. Elizabeth (Zibi) Turtle is a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.  She
    is the Principal Investigator for the Dragonfly New Frontiers mission to Titan and for the Europa Imaging
    System (EIS) cameras on the Europa Clipper mission.  She also participated in the Galileo, Cassini, and
    Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter missions.  Dr. Turtle's research has focused on combining remote-sensing
    observations with numerical geophysical models to study geological structures and their implications for
    planetary surfaces, interiors, and evolution, including: tectonics and impact cratering on terrestrial
    planets and outer planet satellites, the thickness of Europa's ice shell, the formation of Io's mountains,
    and the nature of Titan's landscape and weather.  She earned her PhD in Planetary Sciences from the
    University of Arizona, Tucson, and her BS in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  In
    2021, she was awarded the Claudia J. Alexander Prize by the American Astronomical Society Division for
    Planetary Sciences.

  <h1>Jesse Mee</h1>
  <h2>Air Force Research Laboratory</h2>

  <p>
    Dr. Jesse Mee is a member of the scientific and technical cadre of senior executives, and the Senior
    Scientist for Radiation Hardening Technologies, Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Force Materiel Command,
    Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. He serves as the principal scientific authority and independent
    researcher in the field of radiation effects and mitigation technologies. Dr. Mee initiates, plans,
    coordinates, and evaluates research and development efforts across the AFRL enterprise to deliver
    high-assurance, strategic rad-hard, rad-hard, and rad-tolerant electronics that must operate in natural
    space and high-altitude nuclear detonation environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Mee has been leading foundational research, advanced technology development and radiation-effects
    studies in commercial and rad-hard electronic technologies for over 15 years. He is known for his
    leadership of the AFRL Space Electronics Program, where he planned and directed over $540 million in RH
    electronics investments between 2016 and 2023. In this capacity, Dr. Mee worked closely with partner DoD,
    civil space and industry organizations to secure funding for these efforts, and facilitating transition of
    critical RH technology into defense, intelligence and civil space systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Mee’s government career began in 2008 at AFRL were he designed and executed radiation tests for
    advanced RH electronics. Afterward, he shifted his attention to reliability issues—specifically the study
    of negative bias temperature instability and hot-carrier injection failure mechanisms in
    Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors. His primary contribution was in the development of a
    novel experimental methodology that led to an increased understanding of the physical mechanisms
    underlying the NBTI phenomenon. Dr. Mee then embarked on a multi-year detailed investigation of quantum
    dot mode locked lasers for high-speed intra-satellite data transmission. He authored several foundational
    publications including the first to demonstrate greater than 100-degree Celsius operation of a QD MLL, the
    first to explain puzzling output behavior in a QD MLL at elevated temperature and a theoretical QD MLL
    design to produce a narrower pulse shape and increase the potential data rate for communication
    applications. Dr. Mee later founded the Spacecraft Processing Architectures and Computing Environment
    Research lab to study optimized pairing of mission application codes with various space computing hardware
    architectures. The lab has since grown to over 15 scientists and engineers who have collectively produced
    27 publications since 2014. He is author and co-author of more than 40 journal and conference articles,
    and has served on multiple external advisory boards, independent product teams and RH conference planning
    and steering committees.
